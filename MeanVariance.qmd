## Methods from Adekeye et al., 2012  


$$\hat{\sigma} = b_n \overline{MAD}$$  
 * where $b_n$ is a function of the sample size n.  

 $$\overline{MAD} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j = 1}^m MAD_j$$
 
 $$MAD_j = 1.4826[ Median |X_{ij} - MD_j| \:]$$ 
 $$MD_j = Median(X_{ij})$$
 
 $X_{ij}$ represents a random sample of size n taken over m subgroups.  
 
 * Control limits for specifically monitoring past data should use,
 
 $$ UCL_S = B_4 b_n \overline{MAD} \\
 CL_S = C_4 b_n \overline{MAD} \\
 $$
